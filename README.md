# zipItUp
zip your directories and folders, according to your what you input
purpose: to zip a directory or a folder as simply as possible, and write
         the generated .tar.gz to one of my USB flash drives (or any other location), plans are to add a
         function that will also use 'GnuPG' to encrypt the folder and another
         that will allow user to input a time in order to perform this task
         daily, weekly, monthly, etc. I also want the user to be able to choose
         the destination of the zipped folder. Just wanted to post this up now
         to see if it worked on first attempt and to get a bit of feedback.
         
         Much, much more will be added to this. Just wanted to get it online.
